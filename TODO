First subset of files: PDEVS
-- Using double in PDEVS produces incorrect simulation results, replace by the right datatype in the tests after implementing it.
-- Implement a general runner to replace the one per formalism we currently have.
-- Add debug mode: use boost.log to output message exchange and state changes.
-- Check how to define a parsing model using spirit.
-- Replace the vector<MSG> by BAG<MSG> in PDEVS.
-- Add option to runner to select the FEL, using nullqueue by default now.
-- Upload the documentation
