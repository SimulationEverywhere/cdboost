Install
-- The library is headers only. 
-- It is enough to put the include directory in the path the compiler looks up for them.

Requirements
-- Boost.Test (To run the tests)
-- Boost.Any
-- Boost.Rational (for examples only)

Makefiles
-- To build examples and tests use b2 tool from Boost.

Starting up
-- Build the examples.
-- Start looking at the clock example, it is the easiest one.
-- To read input from files a fstream can be passed to the p_istream model.
-- Advanced example of the p_istream model use can be found in main-custom-event-list.
-- In pdevstone example we show how coupling models can be done using input and programming.
